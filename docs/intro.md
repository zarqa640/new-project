# Physical AI Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI Humanoid Robotics** project documentation. This comprehensive guide covers the development, implementation, and operation of advanced humanoid robotics systems using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and modern AI techniques.

## About This Project

The Physical AI Humanoid Robotics project represents cutting-edge research and development in the field of humanoid robotics. This documentation covers:

- Core system architecture and components
- ROS 2 integration and communication
- Development and maintenance procedures
- Getting started with the humanoid robotics platform

## Getting Started

Begin your journey with humanoid robotics by exploring the foundational concepts and setup procedures:

1. Start with the [Overview](./overview.md) to understand the project structure
2. Follow the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide to set up your development environment
3. Explore the [System Components](./components.md) to understand the architecture
4. Learn about [ROS 2 Integration](./ros2-integration.md) for communication protocols

This documentation provides comprehensive coverage of both theoretical concepts and practical implementation details for developing advanced humanoid robots.
